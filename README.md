# stockMarketAPI

I created this project with the  intention of  acquire some knowledge in API requests  and increase my practice in jquery syntax.
In "Assets Analytics" category, you'll find some registers of any financial asset that you are interested and in "news" category you'll be informed of all the stock market news.
